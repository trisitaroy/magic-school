{"Name":"ART500-CEN AP ART HISTORY","Subject":"['teaching and classroom resources', 'homework and study tips', 'art history', 'education']","Level":"High School","Description":"APÂ® Art History is two semesters long with 180 days of instruction. Each lesson is designed as a 45-minute block of learning time. Every unit is planned to represent at least one of the 10 content areas required by the College Board. A pacing guide is provided to instructors to explain which works of art should be included in each unit, with some flexibility allowed. Students explore a wide range of art, from the earliest works made by prehistoric ancestors in caves to the soaring cathedrals of the Gothic era and beyond. As they study painting, sculpture, architecture, and other artwork across cultures, students acquire tools for careful observation and analysis of visual expression. This course provides opportunities for students to practice new visual vocabulary and concepts through engaging discussions, relevant research, and reports about museum experiences. Course learning objectives and enduring understanding statements that support the three big ideas for AP Art History are integrated into each unit. Instructional activities build student skills to ensure that they master the essential knowledge statements. Students will build on these foundations as they explore works of art, scholarly resources, primary and secondary source documents, videos, museums, and virtual museum visits.","Concepts":"['Learning', 'Museum', 'Knowledge', 'Art', 'Modernism', 'Scientific method', 'Sculpture', 'Formalism']","URL":"https://www.k12.com/high-school-courses.html#high-school/course-details2/5b589874291b925343be1490/"}
