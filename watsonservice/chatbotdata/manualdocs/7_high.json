{"Name":"Drugs and the Brain","Subject":"['health and fitness', 'science', 'physics', 'pharmacology', 'medicine']","Level":"High School","Description":"From Abilify to Zyrtec, the world is full of fascinating drugs. If you are poisoned by sarin nerve gas, you may be able to save your life by huffing some BZ nerve gas. This class will explain that chemical curiosity, along with a host of other interesting tidbits of pharmacology. The structure of the class interleaves basic concepts with specific examples and entertaining tangents, so it is not loaded with boring abstract theory. In the first class you will learn what a neurotransmitter is, and you will immediately apply that knowledge when we discuss the mechanism of caffeine. The class is highly multidisciplinary, including topics such as patent law, medical ethics, history, and the physics of crack pipes.","Concepts":"['Sarin', 'Scientific method', 'Pharmacology', 'Acetylcholine', 'Nerve agent', 'Chemical Weapons Convention', 'Theory', 'Drug']","URL":"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/experimental-study-group/es-s10-drugs-and-the-brain-spring-2013/"}
